What is the chemical equation for **photosynthesis**?

***

The overall equation for photosynthesis is:

$$6CO_2 + 6H_2O + \text{light energy} \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2$$

Or in words:

> Carbon dioxide + Water + Light energy → Glucose + Oxygen

**Location:** Occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells

**Products:**
- $C_6H_{12}O_6$ (Glucose) - used for energy
- $O_2$ (Oxygen) - released into atmosphere
